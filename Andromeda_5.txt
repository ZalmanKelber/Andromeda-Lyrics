ZUGAN

They were earnest boys
Robbed of even the barest joys
And they talked about revolution

Night and day their sweat fell down, straight into the desert sand
With the thrusting of the drill, scraping at the empty land
Fill the air with their heaving
Learn to hope by believing
In an end to the callised feet, the aching knees, the redded hands
The two suns bearing down upon their naked backs
The days before revolution

And they talked about revolution 
In the whispers of fire
Through the glances of ire
The restless murmur stirred 
The shadows heard their word

They peered into her ashen eyes just once a week
Ten minutes each, they took their turns, she didn’t speak
Placidly she looked astray
She saw it in their gaze
She saw that it was revolution

And they talked about revolution…

Two feet wide, their hardened mattress
Two feet wide, their airtight casket 
On the hot sand debilitated
In the mines asphyxiated
Cobalt, lithium, nickel skyward bound
While they stayed fixed upon the ground
The swollen cargo ships climbed into the night sky clear 
And when they looked straight up and watched them disappear
The stars spelled out revolution

And they talked about revolution…

As they scoured through the planet’s thick, metallic veins
The blood of their masters purpled the surface in titanic stains
In the open-air sepulchers, where chaos grows, where panic reigns
No other choice except for revolution 

And they talked about revolution…
