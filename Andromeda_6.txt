NAKATA

I feel a cold vibration
A ghostly incantation
The stranger’s hypnosis is killing my focus, as we risk annihilation

From when we found his station
I’ve felt intoxication
Despite what’s in store, for us in this war, I will not fear this precarious intensification

I can’t stay scared when he’s closer to me
I can’t stay angry when he looks at me
I have to know how he feels about me
Can it ever be?

The peril we’re in
The yearning within
I really don’t know how I’ll shake off this exasperation

I sense with trepidation
We near our immolation
The RNF slaughters our sons and our daughters
The government fascists turn planets to ashes
The missiles are scattered and all sides are shattered
We know our chances are slim

(Ba-da da-ba da-ba-da-ba ba-da da!)

I have an ideation
To be an emulation
Of Milk Way thinking, so loud and unshrinking in feminist liberation

Pursue my own vocation
Write my own declaration
On my own, in charge but alone, yet in spite of these pretentions he is my fixation

I can’t stay scared when he’s closer to me
I can’t stay angry when he looks at me
I have to know how he feels about me
Can it ever be?

The peril we’re in
The yearning within
I’ve gotta find a way to stifle this hallucination

Where can I find salvation?
Have I an obligation
To fight in a battle, to marry like chattle,
To survive on the edge of death’s rattle?
My every option is grim

(The peril we’re in
The yearning within
I’ve really gotta stifle this hallucination)

If hidden machinations
Thwart our eradication
What will I do?  Could we ever try to resume lives of moderation

In this forlorn narration
An endless suffocation
I must escape from this obliteration
But not if it's without him
