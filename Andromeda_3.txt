Verse 1: 

ZUGAN

I could guide us away from our foes
With our cargo on schedule and spotless
But you’d gripe I was thorny and thoughtless
To launch the guns above and drain the fuel tank below

ZHAPUR

I could rue that the route you have chartered for us
leads us due directly towards a black hole
and you’d badger me, tell me the goal
lay just beyond the event horizon’s glistening glow 

ZUGAN

If really you see my decisions as dubious
as we gander the galaxy’s threats
the chaos of the cosmos you clearly don't get
You lie at ease beside me, sit silently and pout

ZHAPUR

You think running reckless solves every bind
Every impulse can remove us from harm
But sooner or later you’ll windup disarmed
Without a way out

Chorus 1:

Verse 2:

ZHAPUR

When you cackle to me you condescend
But will you do so to those we obey
No amount of your daftly display
Will impress them who hold control over our fate

ZUGAN

I won’t listen to lame accusations 
or thankless complaints from the one I protect
Every error I’ve saved us from was yours I suspect
Rescued by those tough choices that you profess to hate

ZHAPUR

Better thankless than thin-headed, if I may say
Better to live selfish if that’s what it takes
Than to perish alone, ponder unknown, never awake
Far from the trees, tresseling breeze, bellowing seas

ZUGAN

Better dead than unmoved by the woes of this world
Better lost than unable to help those who call
But I know that deep down there’s a crack in that wall
That surrounds what is left of your heart ill at ease

Chorus 2:

[]
