Verse 1: 

ZUGAN

I could guide us away from our foes
With our cargo on schedule and spotless
But you’d fuss I was thorny and thoughtless
To launch the guns above and drain the fuel tank below

ZHAPUR

I could rue that the route you have chartered for us
leads us due directly towards a black hole
and you’d badger me, tell me the goal
lay just beyond the event horizon’s glistening glow 

ZUGAN

If really you see my decisions as dubious
as we gander the galaxy’s threats
the chaos of cosmos you clearly don't get
You don’t see things my way you sit next to me and pout

ZHAPUR

You think running reckless solves every bind
Every impulse can remove us from harm
But sooner or later you’ll windup disarmed
Without a way out

Verse 2:

ZHAPUR

It’s so easy to talk down to me
But will you do so to those we obey
No amount of your pompous display
Will impress them who hold control over our fate

ZUGAN

I won’t listen to vain accusations 
or thankless complaints from the one I protect
Every error I’ve saved us from were yours I suspect
Rescued by those tough choices that you profess to hate

ZHAPUR

Better thankless than stubborn, to tell you the truth
Better live selfish if that’s what it takes
Than to ponder alone, perish unknown, never awake
Far from the trees, tresseling breeze, bellowing seas

ZUGAN

Better dead than unmoved by the woes of this world
Better lost than unable to help those who call
But I know that deep down there’s a crack in that wall
That surrounds the remains of your heart ill at ease
