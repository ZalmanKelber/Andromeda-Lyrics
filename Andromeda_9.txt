HENCHWOMAN 2 (to ZUGAN)

In times that are tough, when you travel it’s best not to go alone
Wherever you’re headed, these are treacherous routes that you’ve flown
You’ve passed through our zone
Now your path lies within our control
If you want to come out of this whole
Then get ready to atone

HENCHWOMAN 3 (to KEPODE)

The weak fall behind and the strong live to fight on another day
We’ve captured your ship so you better do all that we say
And if you won’t play 
Then you’ll learn that one rule regulates the galaxy
Nature's law, don't you see?
The predator knocks out her prey

HENCHMAN 2 (to ZHAPUR)

Bow to her, kowtow to her, you’re the type that she will spare
Warrior, don't hurry her, you’ll be useful in our care
We’ve seen a lot like you before, you’re a killer deep inside
You are restless, you’ve got pride
Let your anger be your guide

ENSEMBLE

(We worship you
Mother tell us what to do)

HENCHMAN 2

(Mother, we prostrate ourselves at your feet
We humbly ask of you to help lead us out of defeat)

HENCHWOMAN 2 & HENCHWOMAN 3

Our Queen carries vengence but mercy she hands out in equal force
When in her domain, you had better get off your high horse 
Don’t stray from her course
Her pronouncements come straight from the highest source

With one word from her, we’ll have all of your heads sitting on a pike
With one word from her, you’ll have riches and comfort alike 
Whatever you like
It is yours for the take
Or it’s your worst mistake
It’s whatever you make
When our missles strike
