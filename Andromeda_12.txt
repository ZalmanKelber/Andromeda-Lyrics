ENSEMBLE (LYRA)

We find ourselves near to our story’s end
Our friends near the enemy spacecraft
It is not much longer that we must guide them

Baby, you’ve got what I want!
You’ve got it going on, the way you make me feel so good!
Baby, ya gotta believe me when I tell you
you’re gonna make me do things I never thought I would.
You know I can’t resist you!  Come on, baby,
I can’t say no to you no, no, I really should.
The wicked things that I’d do for ya, baby…

KEPODE

One danger dims and another dawns.
There’s no escape from this marathon.
She’s so devoted, she has to save them
but I can’t deny the sense she’s only someone's pawn.

But this time’s different, I don’t know why.
I suddenly care if I live or I die.
I’m a survivor, well that much is sure.
I’ll give it the best fight I have ‘cause of her

ZUGAN

A murderer is on this trip
who threatens to derail the ship
sabotage its every bolt and chip
I’ve gotta keep my focus ready, eyes open for any tip
I really gotta keep my grip
There’s nothing I can skip

ZHAPUR

The stranger we should have left for dead
leads us to downfall we can’t avoid.
Our bodies will scatter far and wide,
killed by some cold and unfeeling droid
If I do nothing the price will be to get destroyed

ENSEMBLE

Strike, wound, tear him!
Hurt, kill him!
For death, with long arms, claws at the neck.
Shadows, absconding to the deep, dark void
