SOKO

The dragonfly soars above the grass and glides away
He hesitates, jumping side to side, but doesn't stray
His glassy wings never cease, his buzzing never slows
A song that always carries on but who knows where it goes?

On and on, dragonfly, sing your song
For you alone hear it while you freely roam
On and on til nighttime falls
Dragonfly whisper your song as you lift your wings towards home

The boy chased after the dragonfly and looked up high
The clouds stared back and the stars shone down from in the sky
He followed it to the fields and in the distance saw
A different kind of dragonfly that filled his eyes with awe

Up and up, trailing your tail is smoke
A thin white jet on the horizonâ€™s blue
Up and up, with your metallic wings 
That stiffly hold your hardened shell as you fade from view

Outer space has no buzzing things, or humming anywhere
The stars shone faintly through the bare expanse, familiar faces that were always there
Further out, we journeyed on forwards, the stars were not our own
Like strange eyes, guiding the pathways to the unknown

But they too began to fade away, into the distance they disappeared, until they were gone!
Our guiding lights no longer on!
Only dark around, in silence bound, dying, a night without a dawn

The flying thing never goes too high when dangers near
He hides himself under trees and rocks and knows no fear
He lives to travel another day and roam once more
But one day he cannot escape the fate that lies in store

One by one, under the vengeful sun
Enemies have their way, out of the shadows they thrust
One by one, dragonflies hit the ground
Into your shallow graves all of you end your days alone and turned to dust

Dragonfly, go lift your wings, hum another song and
Fly high, the night is safe, the sky's a star-filled dome
Dragonfly spread your wings, dragonfly spread your wings, dragonfly go
And gently fly back home
